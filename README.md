## Introduction to Statistical Learning

This repository holds materials for an introductory course in Statistical Learning.



### Prerequisites / Review

- Multivariate calculus or the equivalent, esp. partial derivatives.
- Linear algebra or the equivalent (matrices, vector spaces).
- Statistical inference or the equivalent.
- Scripting experience in R required.

The material assume that you are familiar with concepts of matrix algebra. In particular, you should be comfortable with notions such as vector spaces, inner products, norms, matrix products/transpose/rank/determinants/inverses, as well as matrix decompositions. 

You should also have some scripting experience---preferably in R---at the level of writing functions, conditionals (if-then-else structures), for loops, while loops, sampling, read in data sets, export results.
